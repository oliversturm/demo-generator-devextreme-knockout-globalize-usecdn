# DevExtreme with CDN URLs and Knockout

This starter project has been created by [generator-devextreme](https://github.com/oliversturm/generator-devextreme) version 1.0.6 and includes [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) and [DevExtreme](https://js.devexpress.com/) widgets. 

These options were used to generate the project:

```
{
  "appname": "demo-generator-devextreme-knockout-globalize-usecdn",
  "apptype": "knockout",
  "localization": "globalize",
  "locales": [
    "de",
    "ja",
    "en-GB"
  ],
  "bundling": "usecdn",
  "language": "js"
}
```

Based on the options, localization support has been included on the basis of [Globalize](https://github.com/globalizejs/globalize). In addition to the language files for the 'en' locale, which are included by default, the following locales have also been added: de, ja, en-GB.
